ComTimeclock is a component (among other things) that is created for viewing
and interacting with <a href="http://www.hugllc.com/wiki/index.php/Project:ComTimeclock">ComTimeclock</a>
 data.  It has both an engineering centric interface and a more user centric interface.  The user
 interface is mostly contained in the plugin that is included.
