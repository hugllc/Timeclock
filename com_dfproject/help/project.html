<h2>MultiDatabase Server Component</h2>
<h3>Introduction</h3>
This component allows for multiple database servers to be defined for code to reach.  This
component must be loaded before any other components that use it.

<h3>Settup up servers</h3>
Go to the components menu, select MultiDb Server, then 'Servers'.  From that screen
you can define servers.  At least one server has to be defined for the system to work at all.

<h3>Referencing the servers in other code</h3>
